<p style="text-align: center;">A journey through the corridors of knowledge, where every step I took paved the way for my academic growth. It all began at Kendriya Vidyalaya, where I embarked on my quest for knowledge. From 2013 to 2019, I embraced the foundations of learning during my matriculation years, creating the solid groundwork for my future endeavors.<br>

    As the years flew by, I found myself back at Kendriya Vidyalaya, ready to explore the vast world of science. From 2019 to 2021, I immersed myself in the captivating realms of physics, chemistry, and biology. With each experiment and equation, my passion for understanding the mysteries of the universe grew stronger.<br>
    
    But the adventure didn't stop there. I decided to take a leap of faith and embark on a drop year, seeking the pinnacle of academic excellence in the form of JEE coaching at AAKASH INSTITUTE. From November 2021 to May 2022, I dove headfirst into the depths of the subjects, determined to conquer any challenge that came my way.<br>
    
    And then came the next chapter. The grand gates of Veer Surendra Sai University Of Technology (VSSUT, Formerly UCE) in Burla opened wide to welcome me into the realm of higher education. Armed with an insatiable curiosity and a passion for technology, I embarked on my Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Information Technology journey in November 2022.<br>
    
    As I write this, I can't help but feel the exhilaration of the path ahead. From coding languages to software development, I'm ready to unravel the intricate tapestry of the digital world. With each passing semester, I know I'll be one step closer to shaping the future through technology.<br>
    
    This educational journey isn't just about grades and certificates; it's about growth, self-discovery, and transforming my dreams into reality. I'm on a quest to learn, to challenge myself, and to embrace every opportunity that comes my way. The journey may be long, but I'm prepared to push boundaries, overcome obstacles, and emerge as a well-rounded individual.<br>
    
    So, here's to the adventures yet to come, to the late nights of studying, the moments of inspiration, and the friendships forged along the way. This is my educational journey, and I'm ready to make it an extraordinary one.</p>
